This project is designed to develop skills in building modern landing pages with HTML and CSS. Following a design template, I had to translate visuals into code, solidifying my grasp of these core languages.

### Objectives of this assignment:

- **Replicate a design:** Recreate a visually appealing landing page using HTML and CSS.
- **Get experience in using flexbox:** Leverage flexbox for efficient layout and user experience.
- **Structure with HTML:** Organize content with effective HTML elements.
- **Style with CSS:** Apply targeted styles for desired visuals (colors, fonts, spacing).

### Live Demo:

The landing page is the same as the design file, and it's also not responsive (only looks good in desktop), so there isn't much to see in this live demo, H O W E V E R.... it's proof that I did it and it exists ðŸ˜†: https://vecchir.github.io/landing-page-project/

### Takeaways:

- Built a complete, modern-looking landing page with just HTML and CSS.
- Breaking down complex designs section-by-section made it easier to approach this assignment.
- Focusing on HTML structure and content before applying any CSS styling makes the development flow more efficiently.
